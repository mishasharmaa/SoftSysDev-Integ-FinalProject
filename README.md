# Software Systems Dev. & Integ. Final Project 

Our group decided to create an online Tic-Tac-Toe game board. We worked with multiple APIs as well as Chat Servers and Web Sockets. All of the concepts that were taught to us in this course!

# Home Page

This is the Home Page for the online Tic-Tac-Toe game. After you type in your username, you decide to play against a computer, join an existing room, or create a new room.

# Playing Against Computer 

This is the page after you choose to play against a computer. After the game is done, you can reset the board and play again or return to the home page and play against another user.
